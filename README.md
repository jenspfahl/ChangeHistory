# ChangeHistory
Simple plugin tracks all changed resources of your workspace and prints it in a time-sorted matter.  Auxiliary the last changed resources (which are located on the top of the table) are more red colored during the older changed resources (which are located on the bottom of the table) are more yellow colored.
